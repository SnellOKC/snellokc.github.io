description: I built this app using the full MEAN stack. Previously, HR was boarding candidates by pen & paper which caused a lack of data to be analyze as well as increased the liklihood of incorrect information. This tool has been implemented since mid-2017 and has increased the turn-around on candidates being boarded by about 300%. In a fast-paced sales environment things need to be handled as fast as possible while maintaining the integrity of the work so this was a much needed tool.
